## Architecture & Trade-offs

### Tech Stack
- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router for modern development
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling for rapid UI development
- **TanStack Query** - Server state management with caching and background updates
- **Shadcn/ui** - High-quality, accessible UI components

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. **Client-Side Data Fetching**
**Decision**: Used TanStack Query for client-side API calls instead of Next.js server components
**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Better user experience with loading states and error handling
- ✅ Automatic caching and background refetching
- ✅ Optimistic updates for favorites
- ❌ Initial page load requires additional API calls
- ❌ SEO limitations for dynamic content

#### 2. **Context-Based State Management**
**Decision**: React Context for favorites instead of external state management
**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Simple implementation without additional dependencies
- ✅ Automatic persistence with localStorage
- ✅ Good performance for limited state scope
- ❌ Would not scale well for complex state interactions
- ❌ Re-renders entire context consumers on updates

#### 3. **URL-Based Filtering**
**Decision**: Store filter state in URL parameters
**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Shareable URLs with applied filters
- ✅ Browser back/forward navigation works intuitively
- ✅ State persists across page refreshes
- ❌ More complex state synchronization logic
- ❌ URL can become lengthy with many filters

#### 4. **Client-Side Pagination**
**Decision**: Fetch all Pokemon data and paginate client-side
**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Instant filtering and sorting without API calls
- ✅ Better user experience with immediate responses
- ✅ Reduced API load after initial fetch
- ❌ Larger initial bundle size (~1000 Pokemon records)
- ❌ Memory usage scales with dataset size

#### 5. **Component Architecture**
**Decision**: Atomic design with reusable UI components
**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Consistent design system
- ✅ Easy to maintain and extend
- ✅ Good separation of concerns
- ❌ Initial setup overhead
- ❌ Can lead to over-abstraction for simple components

### Performance Optimizations

- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with lazy loading and blur placeholders
- **Query Caching**: TanStack Query caches API responses with configurable stale times
- **Intersection Observer**: Only load Pokemon details when cards are visible
- **Debounced Search**: Prevents excessive re-renders during typing
- **Memoization**: Strategic use of useMemo for expensive computations

## What I'd Ship Next

### High Priority (Next Sprint)

#### 1. **Enhanced Search & Discovery**
- **Advanced Filters**: Generation, stats ranges, evolution stage
- **Search Suggestions**: Auto-complete with popular Pokemon names

#### 2. **Performance & UX Improvements**
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Handle large datasets more efficiently
- **Skeleton Loading**: Better loading states for improved perceived performance
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling with retry mechanisms
- **Offline Support**: Service worker for basic offline functionality

#### 3. **Data Enhancements**
- **Evolution Chains**: Visual evolution trees with requirements
- **Move Details**: Comprehensive move information and learning methods
- **Location Data**: Where to find Pokemon in games
- **Breeding Information**: Egg groups, breeding compatibility

### Medium Priority (Future Releases)

#### 4. **User Features**
- **User Accounts**: Cloud sync for favorites across devices
